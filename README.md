Changelog:
- Vectors are separated on chat-level instead of character-level if "Use Per-Chat Collections" is turned on. Just like the native SillyTavern extension, but then with all the perks and features this extension has.
- Vectors will by default be wiped and vectorised on chat-level via the corresponding buttons if the above is turned on.
- Vectorisation fixed in cases where streaming is enabled! Original version of the extension start to vectorise during the streaming instead of when it was finished, resulting in incomplete messages being vectorised.
- {{char}} will be vectored with the characters name instead of generic "You".
